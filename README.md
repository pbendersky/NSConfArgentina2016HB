# NSConfArgentina2016HB
Pablo Bendersky's heartbeat tracking from the day of the NSConf Argentina 2016

In the hopes that someone might find this useful.

In heart-beats.xml you'll find an export from the Healt app of iOS 9.

That file contains:
* My heartbeat (of course)
* Date of birth
* Gender
* Height
* Weight

I took the stage around 9:40 (GMT -3).
